            <img src="img/discoverimg@2x.jpg">
            <p class="quote">“Rick and Morty” is Adult Swim’s most successful series since <span>“South Park”</span>, and has become especially pandemic among college kids.</p>
            <p>Even when the show has been on extended hiatuses, the hype refuses to die down. Why has a show like “Rick and Morty” (which is, among other things, very strange) been able to grab ahold of our attention so powerfully?</p>
            <p>It is more than just the fact that the show’s good; beyond the interesting plots, well-developed characters and cleverly convoluted sci-fi concepts, the series seems to have struck a more profound chord with the younger generation, and fans are able to engage with the “Rick and Morty” universe(s) in unique ways. Basically, the show’s success can be attributed to these two factors: the crazy marketing strategies employed by the “Rick and Morty” staff, and the show’s nihilistic philosophy.</p>

            <img src="img/blauw@2x.jpg">
            <p class="quote">“Rick and Morty” also holds an interesting position as one of the only shows based around the philosophy of nihilism.  Nihilism (in a painfully reductionist nutshell) is the belief that nothing matters; everyone lives in a world dictated by random chance, where nothing has meaning and where purpose is an artifice created by beings who cannot handle the weight of their existential insignificance, etc.

                This is an idea that can be found deeply entrenched in internet culture.  For one, it gives way to absurdism, where the infinitely random nature of the universe finds shape in the twisted imagination of people who spend all day looking at their computers. Dark humor thrives in this environment as well, because if nothing matters, why should anyone care about the sensibilities of anybody?  Memes about existential dread, incurable apathy and even suicide are extremely common.</p>
